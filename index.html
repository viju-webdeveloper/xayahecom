          <div class="text">Improving Your Company Image.</div>
          <p>It's an extremely important factor considering that without a website, blog, or online presence prospective
            clients could begin to wonder how serious you are about business. Today, companies of all sizes and
            industries are establishing a successful online presence.<br>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mySlides fade " id="myslide-2">
          <img src="assets/images/1.HOMEPAGE/reasons to take your business online/3dgirlgear.jpg" />
          <div class="text">Very Low Start-up Costs.</div>
          <p>Starting out online means very low startup costs. You have no buildings to construct, no vehicles to buy
            and few (if any) staff to hire. Simply build your site and start selling. If you are already selling offline
            then the transition can be very smooth. You continue selling the same products that you know and have a good
            supply of. Putting your company online simply gives you a new source of customers.<br>
          </p>

          <img src="assets/images/1.HOMEPAGE/reasons to take your business online/3dgirlhelo.jpg" />
          <div class="text">Better Customer Support.</div>
          <p>With an online presence, you can give them just the information that they are looking for, and just when
            they are looking for it. This means fewer phone calls with technical questions and more sales. You can spend
            more time working on the revenue generating activities in your business and spend less time handling common
            customer service issues.<br>

          <div class="text">Target the Global Market</div>
          <p>With a good website, you can literally have thousands, even tens of thousands (even millions) of people
            visiting your online store at once. Imagine the potential for your company, if you could expose your
            products and services to a potentially unlimited number of interested people.<br>

          <div class="text">Reduce Operation Costs.</div>
          <p>Just one single task can make a significant difference in cost savings. For example, receiving orders
            online reduces the need for customer service staff. With comprehensive sales and product information online,
            you’ll simply receive purchase orders and payments via email or into your database. <br>

          <div class="text">Increase Company Responsiveness.</div>
          <p>The internet allows you to deliver your proposal, purchase order, order confirmation quickly—in many cases
            instantly—to your clients. Online stores will process orders and confirm them to the client. With a
            competent online store application, you can automatically track inventory, sales numbers, outstanding orders
            - everything. Faster response time means happier clients and less administrative work for you.<br>

          <div class="text">Live / Work from Anywhere.</div>
          <p>Are the long cold winters starting to get you down? Are you tired of the constant heat and humidity where
            you live? Taking your business online gives you the ability to have location freedom so you can live and
            work from anywhere you want; you're not stuck to a physical location.<br>

          <p>Even if you have a traditional offline services type business you can generate leads and inquiries while
            you are closed and follow up with those prospects and customers once you open the next day. Many people will
            want to do their research at the end of the day when your office or business is closed, but your website can
            operate and your 2/47 sales person to answer questions and generate leads (or sales).<br>

          <p>The beauty of the internet is that your prospective client(s) can literally be just one click away from
            your online store. Through the internet, you can now educate, instruct and solve clients problems. You can
            accept orders and payments and receive them directly to your inbox.<br>

            <p>Using digital marketing for your hotel can significantly help in market capture but is not a linear
              route; rather it is a combination of many converging routes that help you reach your destination. Hotel
              digital marketing (also known as hospitality marketing) means building and maintaining your hotel's
              presence online. This includes social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram in addition to
              Google and other search engines. <br>
              In today’s era, most of the visitors search for hotels and other services that they provide. With a good
              digital marketing strategy, you’ll be able to approach all these potential guests and build a loyal
              customer base for your business. Guest’s journey begins by discovering your hotel on metasearch engines,
              social channels, or organic search like on Google, Yahoo, and more. Being visible on these channels is
              more important than ever. <br>
              Digital marketing strategies for the hotel business should encompass search engine optimization and
              numerous paid and organic channels to give your hotel visibility throughout the research, consideration
              and final booking phase.

              In the digital world, buying and selling homes is mostly happening through realtor websites. Throughout
              the home-buying process, more and more buyers are taking to the internet first. Contacting an agent or
              using other channels has become the second choice. <br>
              Buyers are doing extensive research online before making their final purchase. So, having an online
              presence has become a crucial marketing strategy in the real estate industry. <br>

              In that process, the necessity of using online marketing tools in real estate has significantly increased.
              <br>

              In fact among all online marketing tools a professional real estate website is most fundamental. If you do
              not have a personalized real estate website, you are missing out on the most effective way to gain new
              business.

            <p>Companies are often reluctant to adopt smart factories for fear of the cost. However, with all the
              benefits listed below, you'll be able to make a better decision with more clarity and confidence.
              Benefits of a Smart Factory include better teamwork, more flexible planning, fewer errors in the
              production process, and better work environments for humans. It also provides a positive impact on the
              environment by lowering waste and reducing pollution.In addition to these benefits, a smart-connected
              factory is also more cost-efficient because it reduces the number of resources used in production.Today,
              technology is evolving faster than ever. Designers and engineers can create more advanced products faster
              and with higher precision. This is because of the increase in tools such as 3D printing and CAD software.
